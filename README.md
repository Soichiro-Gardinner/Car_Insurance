# Car_Insurance

#### Source of data:
The source of the data is Kaggle, a popular online community of data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts.

#### Brief description of data:
The dataset contains information about car insurance policyholders, including their age, gender, race, driving experience, education, income, credit score, vehicle ownership, vehicle year, marital status, number of children, postal code, annual mileage, vehicle type, speeding violations, DUIs, past accidents, and whether or not they had a previous car insurance claim.

#### What is the target?
The target variable in this dataset is the "outcome" column, which indicates whether or not the policyholder had a previous car insurance claim.

#### What does one row represent? (A person? A business? An event? A product?)
One row represents a single car insurance policyholder.

#### Is this a classification or regression problem?
This is a classification problem, as the target variable is binary (0 or 1), indicating whether or not the policyholder had a previous car insurance claim.

#### How many features does the data have?
The dataset has 18 features, including the target variable.

#### How many rows are in the dataset?
The dataset has 10000 rows.

#### What, if any, challenges do you foresee in cleaning, exploring, or modeling this dataset?
One potential challenge in cleaning this dataset could be dealing with missing or incomplete values. Additionally, there may be outliers or inconsistencies in the data that could impact model performance. In terms of exploring the dataset, there may be imbalanced classes in the target variable that could impact the accuracy of the model. Finally, in terms of modeling the dataset, choosing the appropriate algorithm and hyperparameters may require some trial and error experimentation.
